    "No, In C# GetHashCode is not required for equality checks, but it is recommended to override it when you override the Equals method.\n",
    "This ensures that objects taht are considered equal have the same hash code, which can improve performance in scenarios like hash-based collections. However it is not strictly necessary for basic equality checks to work."

    "### Question : Should I implement IEquatable<T> as well? What is the difference between these methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing `IEquatable<T>` in addition to overriding the `Equals` method can provide performance benefits. The `IEquatable<T>` interface includes a single method, `Equals(T other)`, which is specifically designed for type-safe equality comparisons. By implementing this interface, you can avoid the overhead of casting objects during equality checks, leading to potentially faster comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief summary of the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Equals(object obj)` method:**\n",
    "   - Defined in the base `Object` class.\n",
    "   - Requires parameter type checking and casting.\n",
    "   - Often overridden for general object equality comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`IEquatable<T>` interface:**\n",
    "   - Provides a type-safe `Equals(T other)` method.\n",
    "   - Avoids the need for type checking and casting.\n",
    "   - Can improve performance in scenarios where type information is known at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing both the `Equals` method and `IEquatable<T>` is a good practice for comprehensive equality support. The `IEquatable<T>` interface is particularly useful for situations where performance is crucial or when dealing with generic collections that rely on type-specific equality comparisons.\n"
