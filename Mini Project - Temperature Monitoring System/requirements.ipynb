    "**Mini Project: Temperature Monitoring System**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "Create a simple temperature monitoring system using C# without displaying code. The project should consist of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TemperatureSensor Class:**\n",
    "   - Represent a temperature sensor.\n",
    "   - Generate random temperature readings.\n",
    "   - Define a mechanism to notify when a temperature reading is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TemperatureDisplay Class:**\n",
    "   - Represent a display unit for showing temperature.\n",
    "   - Subscribe to the TemperatureSensor's notification mechanism to receive temperature updates.\n",
    "   - Display the latest temperature reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Program:**\n",
    "   - Instantiate a TemperatureSensor and a TemperatureDisplay.\n",
    "   - Utilize a mechanism like delegates and events to establish communication between the TemperatureSensor and TemperatureDisplay.\n",
    "   - Simulate temperature readings and observe the updates on the display.\n",
    "\n",
    "By working on this project, you'll gain practical experience with the concepts of delegates and events in C#."
