It should be instantiated before using like any other reference type. However, if you assign a method to a declared delegate, it would be instantiated automatically behined the scene and you dont need to instantiate it explicitly.\n",

    "```\n",
    "public class ThresholdReachedEventArgs : EventArgs {\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When you want to handle events, you are not limited the the predefined delegates in .Net. You can declare your own delegates and use them to handle events delebrately.\n",
